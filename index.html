                        Chess is a board game between two players, known as <b>White</b> and <b>Black</b>. Each game can end in a win for white (1-0), a win for black (0-1) or a draw (1/2-1/2).
                        The <b>International Chess Federation (FIDE)</b> acts as the foverning body of international chess competition, and assigns <b>official ratings (Elo)</b> to each registered player which can range from 1000-3000, with 3000 being the highest possible score.

                            Becoming a FIDE rating player requires: participation in a FIDE rated event, playing against at least 5 other rated players, and winning at least one of those games.

                            Certain titles can also be awarded based on a players rating. <i>Grand Master (GM)</i> is awarded for an elo of <i>2500+</i> and <i>Women Grand Master (WGM)</i> for <i>2300+</i>. 
                            These are the most prestigious titles, but others are available.

                                        These platforms are not FIDE regulated, so players online ratings are often different to their official FIDE elo. 
                                        Additionally there is much more flexibility online around the time controls of the game, and players can elect to play 'casual' games which do not affect their rating at all.
